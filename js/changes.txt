Kaiten
------

+ IE9 support
+ Fixed a small bug : kTitle should not be set when clicking on a link with no text
+ toggleOptions : moved title click handler code to titlebar click handler 
+ Fixed a small bug : clicking on a focused panel should not try to set focus again
+ setColumnsCount : fixed snapping formula
+ Added "k-newtab" css class => navigables loaded in a new tab
+ Disabled keyboard navigation for touchscreen devices
+ Added downloadable elements, downloaded via an iframe
+ Added base path to Kaiten's state (the path to the folder containing "jkaiten.js")
+ _setPanelFocus : check if document.activeElement exist before trying to do something with it (IE9 support)
+ Fixed a keyboard navigation bug : conflict between ctrl-C (copy) and "normal" "C" key press
+ Links with href="javascript:..." are not handheld by Kaiten
+ Small optim : topBarHeight is calculated out of _computeDimensions
+ We don't assume no more that Kaiten's container is always the whole window
+ _computeDImensions : use k-window width / height to calculate panel layouts
+ Integrated Ben Alman jQuery resize event plugin (http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/)
+ Adjustment : no more Math.floor on columns width calculations, let the browsers round those values
+ Added new "html.dom" connector to retrieve panel content from a (hidden) DOM element
+ Various code changes/improvments thanks to Julien Gonzalez (julien@nectil.com)
+ "html.page" connector : data can be sent to the url
+ Keyboard navigation : discard if the active element is an input
+ New tabs : window.open(url, name) is called with a sanitized name (IE9 support)
+ Renamed panelOptionsHTML to defaultPanelTitleBarOptions
+ Rewrote load, remove and removeChildren to allow the panels loading/destruction to be discarded, see Panel changes
+ Added $.fn.reverse, a utility function that reverse the order of a jQuery elements collection
+ load : you can directly pass a string or a jQuery object 
+ connectors : can now be grouped into collection, with "global" "connectable", "init" and "destroy" functions
+ options > connectors : changed type to Array, which values can be connectors and/or connectors collections
+ Added the connectors/connectors-templates.js file, to provide a basis that should help developers create connectors/collection of connectors

Panel
-----

+ toggleLoader : loader is now moved to the desired container before toggling
+ toggleLoader : can add a loader to any panel element (e.g. a block within the panel body)
+ toggleLoader : disable/enable overflow-y
+ Disabled autofocus for touchscreen devices
+ setTitle : use jQuery to strip tags and decode entities
+ Removed padding from width computations, thanks to the "box-sizing" CSS property
+ Removed layout mode switching capability, the "panelscroll" layout mode cannot exist because the title bar position must always be fixed
+ Improved load : better error reporting when loading fails
+ Improved load : handles local (filesystem) AJAX calls, allowing Kaiten to work without any web server
+ newTab : window.open(url, name) is called with a sanitized name (IE9 support)
+ Renamed optionsHTML to titleBarOptions
+ Titlebar options are now opened by a double-click
+ Titlebar options : by default, insert a "remove panel" clickable item
+ Fixed a bug : when a loader function returns a jQuery element, the events/data are lost when reloading the panel
+ Added "auto" optimal width : allow the panel to occupy the remaining free space on the screen
+ Rewrote the destroy function : destroying a panel automatically destroys its children panels
+ Added a way to discard the destruction of a panel/group of panels ; 
  the "beforedestroy" callback (see panel options) can return false or the "kpanelbeforedestroy" event handler can use preventDefault()
  after the callback has returned, a call to kaiten('execPanelDestroyAction') provides a way to performs the action at the origin of the destruction
  otherwise a call to kaiten('discardPanelDestroyAction') must be made to discard the action at the origin of the destruction
+ Rewrote load
+ reload : removed the keepChildren argument
+ setPositionAndWidth is now a private method
+ Added the "onrefresh" option, providing a way for the developer to perform some actions when the panel content
  has to be refreshed, without reloading the whole panel content

Breadcrumb
----------

+ Added ctrl-click to open target panel in a new tab
+ Changed document title generation : using char "â—€" as separator
+ Changed the appearances of the visible items : removed the white arrows for blue background images, changed markup, rewrote toggleVisibility
+ Added pop()

Templater
---------

+ Changed "summary" markup
+ Removed _$body, _$header, _$block, _$elem - pass "type" parameter to _elem instead
+ Added JsDoc comments
+ Renamed _navigation to _navigable
+ _navigable : changed the strip tags method (use jQuery instead of a regular expression)
+ Added _downloadable
